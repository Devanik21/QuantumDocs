## Overview

Quantumdocs is an LLM-powered application that provides a clean, functional interface for interacting with frontier language models. It goes beyond a simple prompt-response wrapper: it maintains conversation memory, supports configurable system prompts for persona and task specialisation, and provides streaming output for a responsive chat experience.

The application supports multiple LLM backends — OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and locally-running Ollama models — configurable via environment variables without code changes. This makes it a flexible foundation for a wide range of conversational AI use cases: customer support bots, coding assistants, educational tutors, and domain-specific advisors.

The conversation history is managed with configurable memory: either a simple sliding window buffer (last N messages) or a vector-store-backed semantic memory that retrieves relevant earlier context based on the current query. Both modes are implemented and selectable via the sidebar.

---

## Motivation

Building a production-ready LLM chat application requires more than an API call. Memory, streaming, error handling, rate limit management, and a clean UI each add meaningful complexity. This project implements all of these correctly so that it can serve as a solid, reusable foundation for any conversational AI product built on top of it.

## Architecture

```
User message → Streamlit chat UI
        │
  Memory retrieval (buffer or vector)
        │
  LLM API call (streamed)
        │
  Response rendering + history update
```

---

## Features

### Multi-Turn Memory
Conversation history maintained across turns — either as a sliding window buffer or semantic vector retrieval for long-context conversations.

### Streaming Token Output
LLM responses are streamed character by character to the UI, providing low-latency perceived response time.

### System Prompt Customisation
Sidebar text area for runtime system prompt editing — change the AI's persona, task focus, or response format without restarting the app.

### Multi-Model Backend
Switch between OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and Ollama backends via environment variable or sidebar selector.

### Conversation Export
Download full conversation history as Markdown or JSON.

### Token Usage Display
Real-time per-message and session-total token counters in the sidebar.

### Error Handling and Retry
Graceful handling of API rate limits, timeouts, and model errors with automatic retry and user notification.

### Session Management
Create, name, switch between, and delete conversation sessions without page reload.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (or Node.js 18+ for TypeScript/JS projects)
- `pip` or `npm` package manager
- Relevant API keys (see Configuration section)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devanik21/QuantumDocs.git
cd QuantumDocs
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install streamlit openai google-generativeai python-dotenv
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...' > .env
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Usage

```bash
streamlit run app.py

# Use Gemini backend
BACKEND=gemini streamlit run app.py

# Use local Ollama
BACKEND=ollama MODEL=llama3 streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `(required for OpenAI)` | OpenAI API key |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `(required for Gemini)` | Google API key |
| `BACKEND` | `openai` | LLM backend: openai, gemini, ollama |
| `MEMORY_WINDOW` | `10` | Number of messages in sliding window memory |

> Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate all required values before running.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome. Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add your feature'`)
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Please follow conventional commit messages and ensure any new code is documented.

## Notes

API keys for the configured LLM backend are required. Streaming availability depends on the model and backend. Ollama must be running locally for the Ollama backend to work.
